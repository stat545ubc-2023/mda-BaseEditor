# Mini Data Analysis Project

## Project Explanation
This repository contains code for STAT 545A's mini data analysis milestone 1 & 2. This repository explores the dataset *building_permits*, investigating relationships between data within. In Mini Data Analysis Deliverable 1 & 2, there are the instructions that guided this assignment as well as the R code that I have written to fulfill the project requirements. There are sections where I have made selections on data and questions, as well as explanations on why I made these choices. The code found in coding sections alongside its correspodning output. I would recommend reading sections with Decision Headers to learn more about why I made each decision.
