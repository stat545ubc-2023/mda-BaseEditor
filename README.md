# Mini Data Analysis Project

## Project Explanation
This repository contains code for STAT 545A's mini data analysis milestone 1. This repository explores the dataset *steam_games*, investigating relationships between data within. In _______, there are the instructions that guided this assignment as well as the R code that I have written to fulfill the project requirements. There are sections where I have made selections on data and questions, as well as explanations on why I made these choices. The code found under #### Coding Headers can be run in RStudio to observe the explored questions. I would recommend reading sections with #### Decision Headers to learn more about why I made each decision.
